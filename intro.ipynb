You can browse files just like you do in windows, but you can also do things like download packages and pages from the internet, push your code to remote repositories (like github), communicate with other computers using a tool called `ssh` and run programs you've written. The terminal looks like the scary matrix but it's going to become your best friend very quickly.\n",

    "When writing and executing python scripts, it is crucial that your script has access to the right libraries _and_ the right versions of those libraries. For this to happen, these libraries must be installed and accessible to the program. At first, it will be enough to just install them in the 'global' environment, i.e. just install them on your computer via the command line so that every python script you ever write has access to them. \n",

When you install a software library in a virtual environment, it is like putting a tool in that room. Any python script that you run in some environment has access to only those libraries (tools) you've already installed in that environment (room). Because these are virtual spaces, you can make as many of them as you like and the tools from one will never interfere with the tools from another.
